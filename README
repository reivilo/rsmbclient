My first gem cause sambala doesn't work with ruby 1.9 and require some other gems

By the way thanks to sambala ;) i don't reinvent the wheel ...

This class acts as a Ruby wrapper around the smbclient command line utility, allowing access to Samba (SMB, CIFS) shares from Ruby.

First release allow to browse some shares, get and put come in next releases

Example:

  smbclient = Rsmbclient.new( :host     =>  'server',
                              :share    =>  'myshare',
                              :user     =>  'olivier',
                              :password =>  'reivilo')
                      
  smbclient.cd('myfolder')   # =>  true
  smbclient.files => [["myfile", "A", 10, file datetime], ["myfile2", "A", 10, file datetime]]
  smbclient.dirs => [".", "..", "dir1", "dir2"]
  smbclient.path => "./myfolder"
  smbclient.close
